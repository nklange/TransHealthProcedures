# NHS Trans Health - Surgical Procedures and Interventions

This analysis is based on aggregate hospital episodes data published by NHS Digital annually as the 'Hospital Admitted Patient Care Activity' report. The relevant spreadsheets are in [NHSDocuments](https://github.com/nklange/TransHealthProcedures/tree/main/NHSDocuments) (downloaded from https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/hospital-admitted-patient-care-activity ).

The preprocessing of the data is in [Analysis/CollectX15information.R](https://github.com/nklange/TransHealthProcedures/blob/main/Analysis/CollectX15information.R).

The analysis is in the [InitialReport_publicNHSDigital2.Rmd](https://github.com/nklange/TransHealthProcedures/blob/main/InitialReport_publicNHSDigital2.Rmd) file.

The output of that Rmarkdown document is published under
